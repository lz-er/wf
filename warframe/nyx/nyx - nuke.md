blood altar on 2

use with [[okaina - nyx nuke]] to build status stacks with (dual) heavy attack
and [[furis - nyx nuke]] for adding heat procs

notes
- madurai, for faster casting speed
- magus anomaly, on operator 

playstyle
- wait for helios to attack enemy
- blood altar on that enemy
- add 50-200 heat procs with [[furis - nyx nuke]]
- spam ~8 heavy attacks on altar enemy with [[okaina - nyx nuke]]
- wait for slash procs to expire
- cast mind control on blood altar
- (use magus anomaly to drag enemies near)
- uncast mind control (hold)
- quickly cast mind control on enemy near
