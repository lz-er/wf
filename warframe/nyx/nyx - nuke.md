>blood altar on 2
>5 duration archon shards

use with [[okaina - nyx nuke]] to build status stacks with (dual) heavy attack
and [[furis - nyx nuke]] for adding heat procs
and [[helios - nyx nuke]] for initial stack

notes
- madurai, for faster casting speed
- magus anomaly, on operator 

how to play
1. wait for [[helios - nyx nuke]] to attack enemy
2. blood altar on that enemy
3. add 50-200 heat procs with [[furis - nyx nuke]]
4. spam ~8 heavy attacks on altar enemy with [[okaina - nyx nuke]]
5. wait for slash procs to expire
6. cast mind control on blood altar
7. (use magus anomaly to drag enemies near)
8. uncast mind control (hold)
9. quickly cast mind control on closest enemy
10. use 4 to nuke enemies
11. profit ???
